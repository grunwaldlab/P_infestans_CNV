This project included many files that were organized into many directories.
This is an attempt to document the project workflow throughout the directories.


## *.gvcf.gz processing


```
proc_gvcf/proc_gvcf.R
```

This script inputs files from the directory `gvcf/` as a starting point of the project.
This directory contained over 25 GB of data.
GitHub [presently recommends repositories be kept under 1 GB](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota).
So you will have to recreate these files.
In order to recreate these you will have to access the sequences from the SRA, map the to the T30-4 reference, and recreate the gvcf files.


This script processes the `.gvcf` files to infer peaks of allele balance.
Among the outputs are two files (per sample) written to `./peaks/` that include the estimate of the peaks and the counts of heterozygous positions in each window.


## Peak processing


```
peak_proc/peak_cat.R
```

This file processes the peaks from `../proc_gvcf`.
It also needs as input `pinf_ref/pinf_ref_wins.csv`.
The resulting output includes: pinf_freq_wins.csv, and pinf_cnts_wins.csv
